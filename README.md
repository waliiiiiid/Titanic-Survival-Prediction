# Titanic Survival Prediction

**Goal:** Predict whether passengers survived the Titanic disaster using historical data.  

**Tech Used:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  

**Files:**
- `Titanic.ipynb` → Full notebook with code, plots, and outputs
- `Titanic.pdf` → Clean PDF version for quick viewing

**Steps:**
1. Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Encoding Categorical Variables (LabelEncoder & OneHotEncoder)
4. Logistic Regression Model Training
5. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)

**Key Insights:**
- Female passengers had higher survival rates
- Passenger class (`pclass`) influenced survival
- Outliers in fare and age handled properly

**Portfolio-Ready:** Professional notebook + PDF included
